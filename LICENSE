To keep the License simple:

Section 1: You may (not intended to be comprehensive):
a. Use this for personal projects
b. Use this within your company to power other products that are not directly exposing BigHouse as the functionality (e.g. offering a OLAP DB backed by BigHouse)
c. Use this in commercial and non commercial settings
d. Fork, clone, modify, and contribute!

Section 2: You may NOT (not comprehensive):
a. Sell hosted BigHouse
b. Sell a thin layer over BigHouse (e.g. offering a distributed KV store backed by BigHouse)
c. Clone BigHouse without keeping open source and openly referencing BigHouse as the parent

Omission from section 2 is not express or implicit permission. Use common sense. If you are unsure, please reach out! Section 1 is also not comprehensive, there are likely more instances where BigHouse would be well used.

Use common sense to determine if your use case is considered permitted and/or ethical!

The maintainers of BigHouse reserve all rights to modify the License.

Any jurisdiction, action, or proceedings arising under this license or BigHouse will be settled exclusively in the courts of Delaware, USA.

By using BigHouse, you agree to this license.
